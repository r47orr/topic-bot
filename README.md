### As per request from an server owner, I created this simple bot to help people know which is the topic for each of the channels in the server.

## Requested by [Vegato](https://github.com/vekat) from [Learn Portuguese](https://discord.gg/dhnD8XE)

## Written in JavaScript, using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)'s [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) library.

# **Installation and usage**

### Rename the *.env.example* file to *.env* and fill the file as follows:

```
TOKEN=<your-discord-bot-token-goes-here>
```

*Which you can get from [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications)*

### Then, change your preferences in the *config.json* file as you wish and provide your bot ID and your Guild ID in their respective fields.
